User Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis Platform
Project Overview: Developed a comprehensive User Segmentation and Behavioral Analysis Platform designed to analyze user data, segment users into clusters based on their activity and preferences, and provide insights into platform usage and behavior. The platform employs advanced clustering algorithms and machine learning techniques to offer actionable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Key Features:

User Segmentation: Utilizes clustering algorithms (Mean Shift, K-Means, Spectral Clustering, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) to group users based on features such as daily usage, interactions, and demographic data.
Platform Usage Insights: Visualizes platform usage metrics across different clusters to identify patterns and trends.
Behavioral Analysis: Analyzes user behavior to uncover insights related to emotional states, usage patterns, and engagement.
Cluster Visualization: Provides 2D and 3D scatter plots for visualizing cluster distribution and relationships.
Cluster Profiles: Summarizes average values of features for each cluster to understand user characteristics.
Technologies Used:

Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Application Framework: Streamlit
Data Processing: StandardScaler for feature scaling
